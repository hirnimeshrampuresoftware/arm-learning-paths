This is a summary of native tooling available for [Windows on Arm](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/arm/overview) (WoA) applications.

# Visual Studio

[Visual Studio 2022 17.4](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/visual-studio-on-arm-devices) (and higher) natively supports Windows on Arm.

For more information, see [this announcement blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/arm64-visual-studio-is-officially-here/) from Microsoft.

Previous releases required WoA applications to be cross-compiled on other hosts. When run on an Arm platform with x86 emulation, some features were not supported and performance was poor.

Check the [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/arm/overview) site For the latest updates on Arm-native development.

## Install C and C++ support in Visual Studio

During installation process, you will be asked what workloads you wish to install. At a minimum, select `Desktop development with C++`.

See the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vscpp-step-0-installation) for more information.

## Runtime libraries in Visual Studio

If needed, download the Arm64 redistributable [runtime libraries](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.arm64.exe) as described [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist).

## Install LLVM support in Visual Studio

To build native Windows Applications using the LLVM toolchain in Visual Studio, follow these [installation steps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/clang-support-msbuild?view=msvc-170#install-1). For example, Visual Studio 2022 Version 17.5.3 includes LLVM 15.0.1. 


# LLVM toolchain

[LLVM](https://llvm.org/) (LLVM 12 or higher) natively supports Windows on Arm.

Previous releases required cross-compiling on another host, or using x86 emulation. Typically compilation is twice as fast using the native toolchain vs emulation.

You can download the latest LLVM builds from [here](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html).
  - The pre-built binary for Windows on Arm is typically named `LLVM-<version>-woa64.exe`.

The latest version of LLVM with Windows on Arm native support is 16.0.0. The pre-built binary for this version can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/download/llvmorg-16.0.0/LLVM-16.0.0-woa64.exe)

## Compatibility with existing Visual Studio / MSVC projects

LLVM supports `clang-cl`, a compatibility layer for Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC). This means that most developers can use `clang-cl` to compile their C/C++ applications on Visual Studio/MSBuild on the Windows on Arm device, without needing to change the command line. This allows you to easily modify legacy projects that use MSVC to use native compilation.

# WindowsPerf

WindowsPerf is an open-source tool for performance analysis. The WindowsPerf project consists of a kernel mode driver `wperf-driver` and a user-space command line tool `wperf`. It can instrument Arm CPU performance counters. 	

To get started with WindowsPerf on your Windows on Arm machine, go to https://gitlab.com/Linaro/WindowsPerf/windowsperf/-/releases/1.0.1

Then download `windowsperf-bin-1.0.1.zip` under Assets->Packages. Unzip the package. Under the wperf-driver directory, select `wperf-driver.inf`. Right click and install. This will install wperf-driver. You can now count events on your Windows on Arm machine. 

For more about the usage of `wperf` refer to the repository with examples [here](https://gitlab.com/Linaro/WindowsPerf/windowsperf/-/blob/main/wperf/README.md#usage-of-wperf).
